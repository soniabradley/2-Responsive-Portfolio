Make sure to create and save file names before using HTML.

When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS. 

Write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. 
Write your HTML semantically, too:
	If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
	If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
	So on and so forth.

Insert .png and .jpg photos in images Folder.

The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

For Contact Form, use ul (unordered list) and li's and the submit button.

Use Myers Reset for reset.css file.

After all 3 HTML Forms are complete, start adding links for stylesheets in the index.html.  

Be sure to list reset.css, then style.css
i.e. 													
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" 				
	href=""> href="assets/css/reset.css"

then <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=""> 				 	 href="asssets/css/style.css"

Insert both stylesheets in all 3 HTMl Files
