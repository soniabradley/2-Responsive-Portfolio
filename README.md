# Tips
* Make sure to create and save file names before using HTML.
* Code your HTML files before writing any CSS. 
* Write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. 
* Write your HTML semantically.
	If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
	If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
* The "alt" attribute provides alternative information for an image. 
* For Contact Form, use ul (unordered list), li's for submit button.
* Use Myers Reset for reset.css file.
* After all 3 HTML Forms are complete, start adding links for stylesheets in the index.html.  
* Be sure to list reset.css, then style.css.
* Insert both stylesheets in all 3 HTMl Files.
